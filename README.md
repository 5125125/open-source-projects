# Note - Dear contributors, our [old repositpry](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) has been excluded from the Hacktoberfest, due to unknown reasons. If you make a pull request to that repository now, it will not be counted in the HacktoberFest. We will update this [new repository](https://github.com/deepakuniyaliit/open-source-projects) with new rules and guidelines by the end of 6th October 2021. Once we update it, you can make the pull requests to this either by selecting the given list of issues or creating your own issue. Thanks for your cooperation and patience.
